# Specific Description of Azure Function for Web Scraping
In this project, Azure Functions are leveraged to perform automated web scraping and initial data cleaning tasks as part of the ETL pipeline. The Azure Function is triggered on a scheduled basis to scrape data from specific websites using rotating IPs to bypass restrictions and prevent blocking. The scraped data is then sent to the bronze layer of the data lake for further processing.

The Azure Function scrapes product details such as price, resolution, technical specifications, and reviews from various e-commerce platforms. Once the raw data is scraped, it undergoes basic cleaning (e.g., removing null values, correcting data formats) to ensure that it is ready for subsequent transformations in the silver and gold layers of the ETL pipeline.

# Scraping Code and Proxy Rotation
To ensure that scraping is efficient and does not get blocked by target websites, IP rotation via a proxy service (e.g., Bright Data or ScraperAPI) is implemented. This allows the function to rotate between multiple IP addresses, reducing the likelihood of being blocked.





# Scraping with proxy
scraped_data = scrape_data(url, proxies=proxies)
# Benefits of Azure Functions for Web Scraping
Scalability: Azure Functions automatically scale depending on the load, ensuring that data scraping continues efficiently even as web traffic increases or as more websites are added.
Cost-efficiency: With Azure Functions, you're only charged for the function execution time. There's no need to maintain infrastructure for occasional scraping tasks, making it a cost-effective solution.
Event-driven execution: Azure Functions can be scheduled to run periodically or triggered by specific events, providing flexibility in managing scraping frequency.
Seamless integration: Azure Functions integrate smoothly with Azure services like Blob Storage, Data Lake, and Azure SQL, allowing for easy data movement from the scraping process into the data pipeline.
Reduced maintenance: Azure Functions eliminate the need for server management. You only need to maintain the scraping logic, as the infrastructure is managed by Azure.
# Scraping IP Management
By implementing proxy rotation (as shown in the code example), the risk of getting blocked by target websites is minimized. This approach ensures high availability of data scraping operations, even from websites that implement anti-bot measures. The integration of a proxy service further ensures that the scraping function operates seamlessly without disruptions, while maintaining data integrity and performance.

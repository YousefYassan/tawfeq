# Azure Functions for Web Scraping and Bronze Layer Data Cleaning
In this data engineering pipeline, Azure Functions are employed to handle both the web scraping and the bronze layer data cleaning processes. These functions play a critical role in efficiently gathering and pre-processing data before it enters the silver and gold layers of the ETL Medallion architecture.

# Web Scraping with Azure Functions
The web scraping Azure Function is responsible for extracting structured data from multiple web sources. Leveraging rotating proxy IPs, the function ensures robust and reliable data extraction without being blocked or throttled by target websites. The function scrapes dynamic content, including product information, pricing, and reviews, and writes the raw data to the bronze layer in Azure Data Lake Storage.

# Key specifics:

IP Rotation with Proxy Services: To avoid IP blacklisting and ensure uninterrupted data scraping, the function dynamically switches between proxy IP addresses during each scraping request.
Scalability: Azure Functions automatically scale based on the volume of web requests, ensuring consistent performance during high-demand scraping operations.
Event-Driven Execution: The function triggers based on scheduled intervals or HTTP requests, facilitating regular updates of the scraped data.
Bronze Layer Data Cleaning
Another Azure Function is responsible for performing data cleaning in the bronze layer. This layer stores raw data, and the cleaning function focuses on detecting and handling data anomalies such as full nulls in specific fields, including product titles. It ensures that data integrity is preserved before moving to the silver layer for further processing.

# Key cleaning operations:

Title Validation: The function searches for records where the title field is fully null and either flags these records for further review or attempts to fill missing values based on business rules.
Null Handling and Standardization: This function also removes, fills, or corrects null values and standardizes the structure of the data to meet the required format for downstream processes.
# Benefits of Using Azure Functions:
Serverless and Cost-Efficient: Azure Functions eliminate the need for manual resource management by automatically scaling up or down based on workload, significantly reducing costs during low activity periods.
Event-Driven Architecture: The functions can be triggered by various events, such as the arrival of new data or on a scheduled basis, ensuring real-time or near-real-time processing of data.
Seamless Integration: Azure Functions easily integrate with other services like Azure Data Lake, Synapse Analytics, and Data Factory, creating a cohesive and efficient ETL process.
Reduced Operational Overhead: The serverless nature of Azure Functions minimizes maintenance efforts, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure management.
Resilient Data Scraping: Through proxy IP rotation and retry mechanisms, Azure Functions ensure reliable data scraping even in the face of rate limits or site restrictions.
This architecture ensures high scalability, flexibility, and accuracy in data scraping and pre-processing, streamlining the overall ETL pipeline and preparing high-quality data for further transformations in the silver and gold layers.

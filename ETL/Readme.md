# ETL Process and Medallion Architecture
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process in this project is implemented using a combination of Azure Functions for data extraction and Azure Data Factory for orchestrating the transformation and loading into the Data Warehouse. The pipeline is designed to support a Medallion Architecture, which enhances data reliability, traceability, and accessibility.

ETL Pipeline Overview
Extract:

The extraction process involves scraping data from various external sources (e.g., websites, APIs) using Azure Functions. These functions are responsible for extracting raw data in formats like JSON or CSV.
The raw data is initially ingested into the Bronze Layer (Raw Storage) within Azure Data Lake. The bronze layer stores unprocessed data in its original format to ensure data lineage and provide a historical record of all raw data ingested.
Transform:

After the raw data is ingested into the bronze layer, it is cleaned and transformed in multiple stages:
Bronze to Silver:
In the transformation phase, the raw data is cleaned (e.g., handling missing values, data type conversion, and standardizing column names) and normalized. This stage is handled by Data Flows in Azure Data Factory or through PySpark jobs on Azure Databricks.
The transformed data is then moved to the Silver Layer, which stores the cleaned and standardized data that is ready for further enrichment and analysis.
Silver to Gold:
In the final transformation stage, the data is aggregated, enriched, and joined with other data sources to generate high-quality, business-ready datasets. These datasets are moved into the Gold Layer, which holds the most refined and analytical data.
In this stage, business logic and calculations are applied to generate key metrics like financial indicators, product performance, and customer insights.
Load:

The cleaned and enriched data from the Gold Layer is loaded into the Azure SQL Data Warehouse for fast querying and reporting. The loading process is managed by Copy Data activities in Azure Data Factory, which efficiently transfers data from the lake to the warehouse.
The Data Warehouse serves as the central repository for business intelligence and reporting needs. End users can access the data via dashboards, reporting tools, or ad-hoc queries.
Medallion Architecture
The ETL process follows the Medallion Architecture to ensure the data is processed in layers of increasing quality and reliability.

Bronze Layer (Raw Data):

Contains the unprocessed, raw data as it is extracted from various sources (e.g., website scraping, API calls).
This layer preserves the original form of the data for traceability, and allows for reprocessing if needed.
Azure Functions are used to extract and load the data into the Bronze Layer in Azure Data Lake.
Silver Layer (Cleaned and Structured Data):

In this layer, the raw data is cleaned, validated, and structured into a consistent format.
This includes transformations such as standardizing column names, fixing data types, and handling missing or erroneous values.
The data in the Silver Layer is ready for further enrichment and analysis. It is the clean version of the original data, but without complex business logic applied yet.
Gold Layer (Aggregated and Enriched Data):

The Gold Layer contains the final version of the data that is ready for reporting and analytics. This layer includes enriched data, such as aggregated metrics, KPIs, and dimensions required for business insights.
This data is optimized for performance and used by dashboards and reporting systems, providing business-ready insights.
# Benefits of Medallion Architecture in ETL:
Data Lineage and Traceability: By organizing data into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers, the Medallion Architecture provides a clear audit trail, making it easier to track data transformations and ensure data quality.

Scalability: Each layer of the Medallion Architecture is designed to handle increasing levels of data transformation, allowing for scalability as the dataset grows in size and complexity.

Data Quality: The layered approach ensures that raw data is preserved in its original form while higher layers provide increasingly refined, cleaned, and enriched datasets, ensuring high data quality for decision-making.

Flexibility: Since each layer is independently maintained, reprocessing or transforming data at different stages is flexible. If the business logic changes, only the Gold Layer may need adjustments without reprocessing the entire pipeline.
